# Nature of code

[Nature of code](http://natureofcode.com) examples and exercises implemented in
Lisp using [trivial-gamekit](https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit).

Code samples are organised per chapter. To run them, follow the
[install instructions](https://borodust.github.io/projects/trivial-gamekit/#installation-and-loading)
of trivial-gamekit and `(ql:quickload :trivial-gamekit)` before compiling.

Note: `trivial-gamekit` only supports 2D animations, so examples and exercises
involving 3D are omitted.
